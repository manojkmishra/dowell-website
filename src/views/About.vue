                <span >In the cut and thrust of the building industry, as well as in the Australian 
                    business world more generally, it’s unusual for a company name and ethos to 
                    remain unchanged, but such is the story of Dowell. Tracking through a history 
                    which now quite remarkably crosses into three centuries, Dowell’s reputation for
                    quality workmanship and design innovation goes back to its earliest days. Back,
                    in fact, to a gold rush...

                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1857</span>Charles Dowell (aged 37), arrives in Melbourne - a boom town, with a whole clan in tow: his wife and six children, as well as a brother and two brothers-in-law (Appold and Bailey), along with their families. Melbourne was bursting. In one year alone the number of buildings doubled. Everything was needed at once: housing and commercial premises; public buildings and infrastructure. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1860</span> C. Dowell & Sons is founded by Charles Dowell, an architectural wrought iron foundry with his brother Henry – and possibly Bailey – but it was Charles who headed the business that is to become the main trunk of the tree that is Dowell today
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1900</span>Fitzroy City Press - reports: ‘Mr. C. Dowell owns the blacksmith’s shop at No. 75 Johnston Street, and machinery suited for ornamental iron and copper work, such as verandahs, gates, etc., in fact, all high class work.  He has been doing business for over a quarter of a century.  Mr. C. Dowell, senior, is over 80 years of age, and is yet active, and may frequently be seen working at his trade – his eldest son at present manages the business, employing some half a dozen hands, at times a great many more.  A large quantity of balconettes and grilles being recently constructed for several hospitals, are well known 
                and in such high repute that constant orders are always coming in.  Several iron gates and flower stands are ready on sale.’ 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1905</span>Charles Dowell died, leaving Charles II to carry on at the foundry in partnership with a fellow named Langdon. Some of Charles II’s best work was produced during these pre-war years and Charles II proudly claimed he never had a job returned or condemned. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1913</span>Leslie Roy Dowell starts working in the business. Seventeen year old and doing routine jobs around the place, Roy joins his eldest brother, Charles III, the last in the family to be trained as a blacksmith.

                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1915</span>Charles III and Langdon, the partner, leave for war. Leaving Roy to work with his father and gradually take on more responsibilities. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1918</span>At war’s end Charles III and Langdon both returned and the partnership was spilt, necessitating the sale of factory and plant. Roy and Charles III were given land by their father to build a new factory in the same area, at 2 Scotchmer Street, Fitzroy. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1922</span>C. Dowell and Sons [registered as a proprietary limited company in 1922] supplied the steel windows to buildings such as Willis & Co. in Little Collins Street, Craig Williamsons in Elizabeth Street and the Postal Store in Spencer Street. The factory was set up for efficiently making these new steel window frames and there was little blacksmithing. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1928</span>1928 Roy traves to the USA and England to research fire door products for use in multi-storey buildings. While in the USA, Roy secured licensing deals for a range of products including metal fire doors, elevator doors and metal door frames, as well as several other metal products specifically for hospitals. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1935</span>The Dowell factory was expanded, perhaps in part to facilitate the filling of a contract to supply windows for the spare parts and administrative buildings at the new headquarters of General Motors-Holden at Fishermans Bend. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1940</span>Roy travelled to the USA, returning with a revolutionary design for pressed metal double hung windows. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1945</span>After the war, Dowell rode a wave of expansion. New products, new factories and new sales networks were progressively rolled out to meet the needs of the times. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1948</span>At the invitation of the Tasmanian government, Dowell’s first new factory was built in Moonah, Tasmania. in 1948 by the Premier Robert Cosgrove, the Dowell Industries (Tas) Pty Ltd factory employed sixty workers and produced steel window frames and stainless steel sinks. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1949</span>Roy Dowell travels back to the USA to negotiate rights to the aluminium designs of the General Bronze Corporation. Headquartered in New York, General Bronze was one of the largest window manufacturers in the world. On his return Roy formed Dowell Aluminium Windows Pty Ltd. He then bought five acres of land in Albert Street, Preston for a new Melbourne factory.
                    <br/><br/>
                Throughout this era, Dowell was involved in many major building projects across the country. Some of the most noteworthy include H.C. Sleigh House (the first office block to be erected in post-war Melbourne in 1953); the Queen Mary Nurses’ Home at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney (1956); Essington Lewis House in Melbourne (head office for BHP, 1959); and the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne (1962). Perhaps the most prestigious project of all was the AMP Building at Circular Quay, Sydney, completed in 1962. Dowell provided the curtain walling for this 120 metre high tower with its curved facade, which is still significant today as Sydney’s first skyscraper. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1959</span>In response to changes during the 1950s Dowell went through two major restructures. First, the original C. Dowell & Sons merged into three new registrations: Dowell Holdings Pty Ltd; Dowell Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd; and Dowell Steel Windows Pty Ltd. Responding to financial advice in 1959, the company was floated, becoming Dowell Australia Ltd. Roy Dowell was designated managing director and was chairman of the small board which included his son, John Dowell, as executive director. The family company, Dowell Holdings, was the main shareholder and retained ownership of property. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1960</span>Dowell offered a comprehensive range of architectural products which included: aluminium windows and doors; curtain walling for multi-storey buildings; pressed metal fire doors and frames; lift doors and frames; industrial steel windows; and Sanymetal partitioning for hospitals. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1966</span>Roy Dowell agreed to a negotiated, joint take-over by Alcoa and Overseas Corporation, a deal ultimately worth around $1.75 million.
John Dowell resigns six months later, ending over a hundred years of family leadership. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1968</span>New factory in Queanbeyan for the fabrication of aluminium door and window frames, and flyscreens is built. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1970 -1980</span>Dowell continued to thrive. The business was simplified in that pressed metal products were no longer produced. Profits hit all-time highs and design innovation continued in both the commercial and residential sides of the business. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">1988</span>Dowell celebrate their 130th birthday, with the news they had won an Australian Design Award for its XD-3 sliding aluminium window. Several years of research and field testing had gone into the product.
                    <br/><br/> Alcoa divest itself of the window business and Dowell Australia Ltd passes into the hands of Boral, which had an existing interest in the sector. 
                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">2012</span>Dowell is awarded the Housing Industries Association GreenSmart product of the year award for its ground breaking ThermaLine range. Dowell Double glazed and thermally broken, ThermaLine aluminium window and door frames offered unprecedented thermal performance and energy efficiency.

                <div class="year1"><span class="year">2013</span>Dowell is acquired by Chaberol Pty Ltd, a Queensland based, family-owned investment company and Dowell Windows Pty Ltd operates as a standalone company.

                </div>
                <div class="year1"><span class="year">Today</span>Dowell continues to prosper. With nine manufacturing locations and offices around Australia, it employs over 600 people. 
                    <br/><br/>
                The first Charles Dowell, standing as a newcomer all those years ago in the gold rush streets of Melbourne, could never have imagined that products bearing his name would, for generations, be part of the daily lives of so many Australians, in their offices, factories and homes. His eagerness for the new, was to be the story of Dowell. New designs, new products, new materials, new manufacturing processes, even new ways of doing business – whatever the circumstances of the times, innovation has always been embraced at Dowell. And always, a certain kind of business and engineering intelligence has prevailed, one which holds that quality should underpin everything, at every level. From the nineteenth century to the twenty-first, these are the values which have kept Dowell vibrant and alive. As history plainly shows, the oldest window manufacturer in Australia has always been modern.
