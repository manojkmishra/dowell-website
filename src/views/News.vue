            <p class="mini-heading">02 February 2019</p>

            <p class="p-news">So it all started off with a $10 deposit to reserve a spot at the Christmas
                party that led to our idea of instead of the money being refunded to the person
                on the day, let’s fundraise for a charity. A decision was made to go with the
                charity Drought Angels who support our farmers who are in hardship. This
                decision was a no brainer for us as forecasters were predicting another
                scorching hot summer with not much rain, and with 60% of Queensland’s land mass
                already fully drought declared.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Well we gathered a whopping $720 in December which was a great effort and as
                the announcement was about to be made to the team of how much we had raised Darin
                advised that Dowell were going to match dollar for dollar. So now $1,520.00 “smackeroos”
                are going to much needed families across QLD and NSW to help with daily living.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Thank you to all of the Geebung Dowell team that donated to fund this charity and our
                much needed farmer families, and would just like to add that when the Dowell Team puts
                their minds to something, the Dowell Team gets results.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Proud to belong to Team Dowell. #TeamDowell</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">06 November 2018</p>

            <p class="p-news">It’s no secret that our farmers have been hit hard. With very little rainfall in
                regional areas, they are doing it tough, having to sell their livestock and take
                drastic measures just to survive.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Dowell (Australia’s oldest window and door company) has seen it’s fair share of hard
                times over it’s 158 year history and is always ready to jump in and help out fellow Australians
                in need. Recently Dowell chipped-in (one full truck), when two full trucks were loaded with bales
                (74 in total) and delivered to properties in the Tamworth (Dungowen) NSW region on the weekend of
                the 27th and 28th October 2018, by Dowell driver Terry Boyles, in support of the City Slickers Appeal.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Terry attended to some 20 properties and covered a distance of around 800km. The bales were a welcome
                sight to farmers and livestock. “They’re very proud, and getting them to accept the bales is the hardest
                thing,” said Terry. This was Terry’s fourth trip with the City Slickers Appeal, with past deliveries to
                Baradine NSW, Wee Waa NSW and Willow Tree NSW already completed, Terry is now planning another trip before Christmas.</p>

            <p class="p-news">The major storms in Sydney on Wednesday night 11th March 2015 hit the Dowell Smithfield site in a big way. On
                coming to work early on Thursday morning staff found the storms had cut all electricity to the site.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Aware of the impact this was going to have on our customers Dowell staff and management teams pulled together
                quickly to make alternative work arrangements. Dowell’s cloud based IT systems meant that working remotely was a
                possibility with staff either working from home, on mobile devices or at the offices of Dowell’s sister companies
                G.James and Wunderlich Plastics.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Power crews worked for 2 days with the power coming back on late Friday. Just in time for the production teams
                to work the weekend to get production schedules back on track.</p>

            <p class="p-news">Every business will face some unavoidable challenges at times and is during those tough times that teams and
                people show what they are made of. Well done to the Dowell Smithfield team!</p>
