            <p class="p-therma">For generations, the Dowell name has been synonymous with creating innovative window and door solutions in Australia.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Holding true to its name, Dowell added a sliding door and four new energy efficient windows into its ThermaLine™ range;
                the awning, multi‑transom awning, sliding, and fixed windows. These windows and doors herald a new era in affordable, energy
                efficient design and in 2012 was awarded the HIA GreenSmart product of the year award.</p>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">HIA Judges stated; “ThermaLine™ Windows are a versatile, high performing and cost effective aluminium window range. The new
                ThermaLine™ frame has a similar thermal performance to the installed glass. With Uw-values* as low as 1.7, the windows are rated
                the best in its class. The low Uw-values benefit homes with large amounts of glazing to achieve 6 stars or better. The product
                range consists of an awning window, fixed window, slider window and sliding door designed to be a cost effective solution for
                energy savings to the residential housing market.”</p>

            <p style="font-size:13px;">*U-value relates to the entire window and incorporates the U-values for the glazing ‘Ug’ and the frame
                ‘Uf’. Reference source: Window Energy Rating Scheme [online] Available: www.wers.net.au, based on double glazed thermally broken
                aluminium windows and doors (13 November 2014).</p>

                The Sensitive Choice® blue butterfly symbol is a way of recognising products and services that may be better for people with
                asthma and allergies.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Assessed by an independent panel, products and services carrying the butterfly have attributes that assist with reducing

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell is supporting the National Asthma Council Australia’s efforts to improve asthma and allergy care. In choosing a Dowell
                ThermaLine™ window or door you are choosing to lower the likelihood of condensation formation, thereby lowering the risk of
                dust mite and mould growth.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The Dowell ThermaLine™ range has exceptional air infiltration performance – an important factor if the conditions inside a
                home are to be strictly controlled.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell ThermaLine™ windows and doors are double glazed, thermally broken aluminium frames. All Dowell ThermaLine™ products
                have been independently tested and verified in accordance with the Australian Window Association Windows Energy Rating Scheme

            <h2 class="blue thick">COMFORT</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">The Dowell ThermaLine™ window and door product range consistently produce very low Uw-values.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">During winter or in cooler climates Dowell ThermaLine™ windows help reduce cool air entering
                the home and help keep warm air indoors. Condensation is reduced considerably, which often occurs
                as a result of large differences in temperature between the interior and exterior environments.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In summer or warmer climates Dowell ThermaLine™ windows help act as a buffer against the hot
                air outside, minimising the transfer of heat into a building. Dowell ThermaLine™ will help
                minimise the loss of cool air, reducing the size and need for air-conditioners.</p>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">Solar Heat Gain Co-Efficient (SHGC) is a measure of how much solar radiation passes through a
                window. For comfort during the summer months, the smaller the SHGC the better.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">With SHGC’s as low as 0.18* for the hotter climates and SHGC of 0.55* for the cooler climates,
                the Dowell ThermaLine™ range will help provide comfort in a home year-round and reduce the need
                for air-conditioning at home.</p>
