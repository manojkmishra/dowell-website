            <h2 class="blue thick">U-VALUES</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">What is a U-value?</p>

            <p class="p-therma">A U-value is a measure of heat transfer/loss in a building element such as a wall, floor or roof. It can also be referred to as
                an ‘overall heat transfer co-efficient’ and measures how well parts of a building transfer heat. This means that the higher the U-value
                the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as it is a way of predicting the composite behavior of
                an entire building element rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">Why use U-values?</p>

            <p class="p-therma">U-values are important because they form the basis of any energy or carbon reduction standard. In practice, nearly every external
                building element has to comply with thermal standards that are expressed as a maximum U-value.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Knowledge of how to simply calculate U-values at an early stage in the design process, avoids expensive re-working later on in a project.
                It allows the designer to test the feasibility of their project at an early stage to ensure it is fit for purpose and will comply with
                regulatory frameworks.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Many people underestimate the role of the window frame in energy efficient home design. Without windows our homes would be dark and
                uninviting. Windows play a critical role in your home’s comfort and energy consumption. They set the tone of your home by providing daylight,
                views, ventilation and a sense of spaciousness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">The use of modern performance glass and the thermal break technology in Dowell ThermaLine™ allows the home owner to have large windows
                while delivering outstanding energy efficiency and comfort. In fact, the most energy efficient windows result from a combination of both
                an insulated frame and the right glass to achieve superior energy performance.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell ThermaLine™ windows have been rated as the most energy efficient thermally broken aluminium windows on the Australian residential
                market today, based on a glass to glass comparison*.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">THE SUN-PATH</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">The simplest way to assess the passage of sun across a site is by observation. A site visit can also help identify site-specific conditions,
                how obstructions such as adjacent buildings, trees and landforms will impact on the site and the potential design, how the site’s shape, slope
                and orientation affect solar access.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Sun-path diagrams provide a broader overview of the sun on a site, as they map the path of the sun across the sky at different times during
                the day throughout the year. They can help establish the position of the sun relative to a site and can be used to determine the effect of
                shadows cast by buildings, trees and landforms on and around the site.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In the sun-path diagrams, the centre is the point of observation and the arcs represent the sun’s altitude angle at different times of the
                day throughout the year, using a 24 hour clock (12 hours ahead of GMT), rather than solar time. They are accurate to approximately 1 degree
                north or south of the allotted latitudes, however it is important to have accurate contour lines when using them.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Altitude and azimuth</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The position of the sun with respect to an observer is commonly represented by two angles – altitude and azimuth. Altitude is the angle
                of the sun’s rays compared with the horizon. At sunrise and sunset, the altitude is zero, and in the southern hemisphere,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">the maximum altitude of the sun at any specific location occurs at solar noon on 21/22 December (longest days of the year).</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Azimuth (sometimes known as bearing) is the direction of the sun as shown on a compass. Solar or ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the energy
                from the sun. The amount of solar radiation available on a site depends on the latitude and the sunlight hours received.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Shade is often required in summer, but in most parts of the country, winter sun is desirable. Obstructions on a site may block sunlight
                access at times when it is required.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">When considering sunlight and building design, assess the impact of obstructions in the future as well as the present. For example,
                a small tree on an adjacent site may grow into a large one that blocks sun, a building may be erected on a currently vacant site or an
                existing building may be demolished and replaced by a larger one. Alternatively, existing trees may be retained for summer shade.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Calculating the sun-path</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Using web based tools to calculate the sun path can easily determine which window configuration would be most suitable on a particular
                side of the building. Resulting in a clever design combination of Dowell Thermaline™ and Dowell standard double glazed or single glazed windows
                to achieve maximum cost-energy efficiency building solution.</p>
