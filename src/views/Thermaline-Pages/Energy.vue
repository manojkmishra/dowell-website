            <h2 class="blue thick">FUTURE PROOFING BUILDINGS</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">In the past 100 years the low cost of energy has allowed architects to design buildings that can ignore
                natural ventilation, daylight and the suns energy, by replacing it with an artificial environment that is
                air-conditioned, humidified and artificially lit. This approach emerged through the harnessing of energy
                from fossil fuels, but with the move away from energy dependence this has translated into a fresh approach
                to housing design.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In Europe housing design has embraced the concept of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) as the response to
                changing environmental pressures. In general the term ‘future-proofing’ refers to the ability of something
                to continue to be of value into the distant future; that the item does not become obsolete.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">Principles of future-proofing buildings</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Some of the principles of future-proofing buildings include; Nil deterioration of existing materials
                by other structures or materials and products used in building construction, the encouragement of design
                flexibility, the building design adaptability in relation to the environment, consideration to the occupant
                needs, and future technologies.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">Building design and features should enable a long service life and increase durability. Provide products
                with the capacity to meet future requirements and thereby reduce the likelihood of obsolescence. Taking
                into consideration the long term life-cycle benefits by calculating the future benefits against initial costs.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The term ‘future-proofing’ in relation to sustainable design began to be used in 2007. It has been used more
                often in sustainable design in relation to energy conservation to minimise the effects of future global temperature
                rise and/or rising energy costs. In the context of building, the term usually refers to the ability of a structure to
                withstand impacts from future shortages in energy and resources, increasing world population, and environmental issues,
                by reducing the amount of energy consumption in the building.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Window design and performance in Australia has traditionally lagged that of Europe, North America and New Zealand.
                This has largely been driven by builders designing to price points that have not allowed some of the high performance
                window and door systems to be adopted in Australia.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In Europe the climate extremes and rising energy costs were pivotal in the adoption of higher standards of fenestration.
                In North America the oil shocks of the 70’s and subsequent power blackouts saw the rapid adoption of the PVC double glazed
                windows and doors displacing aluminium systems. The North American window industry subsequently developed thermally broken
                aluminium products and a large share of the market was regained.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-3 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">In most economies, regulation has played an important part as it has in Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, consumer
                demand has, however, overtaken regulatory requirements largely driven by the ‘Future-Proof Build’ programs that have
                seen double glazing dominate the new house window market. More recently, thermally broken systems have become popular,
                as design and performance have become critical in consumer purchasing and construction thinking.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The global approach to improving building performance has gained traction and these tend to be based on overall U-value for
                the building. Windows represent a large part of the building envelope area and become an increasingly critical design element
                to achieving the overall target U-value.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">MECHANISMS OF CHANGE</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">Regulation has been the main driver of change with mandatory requirements established. These have commonly been based on
                prescriptive codes based on U-values for individual construction elements.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In Australia, the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) supports the efforts of the Australian Governments to reduce
                the energy and greenhouse gas impact of residential buildings. NatHERS encourages energy efficient building design and
                construction by providing a reliable way to estimate and rank the potential thermal performance of residential buildings in Australia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">

            <p class="p-therma">Heating and cooling accounts for the majority of the average Australian household’s energy use, but efficient building design can reduce the
                reliance on artificial temperature controls. To determine how efficient the design of a home is, it is given a star rating between zero and ten stars.
                Homeowners can make use of these ratings to determine modifications to existing houses or in planning the designs for a new house.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The star rating is calculated using software accredited for this purpose under NatHERS. The software simulates expected conditions based on
                climate zones and other known factors about the location, occupancy and dimensions of the house. Allowances are made for different sized houses
                and different climates to ensure a fair comparison of </p>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">buildings and consistent ratings across Australia. While the software can be used by anyone, only an assessor who has received NatHERS accreditation
                from a relevant organisation can provide a credible rating.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">NatHERS tools provide one method of demonstrating compliance with the minimum energy efficiency standards for new residential buildings outlined under
                the National Construction Code (formerly the Building Code of Australia). Additionally, NatHERS software is a powerful tool for optimising energy efficient
                house designs for Australian climates. It also highlights the weakest link in the building envelope.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The Australian Window Energy Rating Scheme (WERS) audits and provides the window ratings used in building design and are available on the WERS website.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">PASSIVE HOUSE</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">The main difference between a passive house window and a standard window is that the windows within a passive house play an important role by reducing
                the heat loss from the house. Passive windows are insulated and trap solar gains within the building. Passive homes require double low-e or triple
                glazed windows to ensure the correct U-value is achieved. Insulated frames are also used to minimise heat loss and ensure the occupants comfort within
                the building.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Standard windows don’t have insulated frames and sometimes only have single or double glazing, by using these windows in a passive house the occupants
                will not be comfortable due to the huge temperature difference between the window and the wall, there might also be problems with thermal transfer and
                condensation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="mini-heading">The ‘Passive House’ standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements:</p>

            <p class="p-therma">1. The building must be designed to have an annual heating and cooling demand as calculated with the passive house planning package of not more than
                15 kWh/m² per year (4746 btu/ft² per year) in heating and 15 kWh/m² per year cooling energy, or to be designed with a peak heat load of 10W/m².</p>

            <p class="p-therma">2. Total primary energy (source energy for electricity) consumption (primary energy for heating, hot water and electricity) must not be more than
                120 kWh/m² per year (3.79 × 104 btu/ft² per year).</p>

            <p class="p-therma">3. The building must not leak more air than 0.6 times the house volume per hour (n50 ≤ 0.6 / hour) at 50 Pa (N/m²) as tested by a blower door.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">Passive solar design can also be used to optimise the free energy from the sun. Depending on the expanse of glazing, orientation and available shading,
                it is likely that the window specification (glass and frame) required will be Uw 2.0 or below.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Of the three defined, a typical passive house accounts for as much as 50% of the heating and air-conditioning loads, and accounts for most of the discomfort
                due to draughts or excessive heat gains. A typical Australian home built before 2000 would likely achieve an airtightness test result in the realm of 10 air
                changes per hour (ACH), measured in a pressurised building (to 50Pa), and in many homes this can be up to 25 ACH.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">Zero Energy Building</p>

            <p class="p-therma">A zero-energy building, also known as a zero net energy (ZNE) building, is a building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total
                amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site. These buildings
                still produce greenhouse gases because on cloudy (or non-windy) days, or at night when the sun isn’t shining, and on short winter days, conventional
                grid power is still the main energy source. Because of this, most ZNE buildings still get half or more of their energy from the grid.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called ‘energy-plus buildings’ and buildings that consume slightly more energy
                than they produce are called ‘near-zero energy buildings’ or ‘ultra-low energy houses’.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Traditional buildings consume 40% of the total fossil fuel energy in the US and European Union, and are significant contributors of greenhouse
                gases. The zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil
                fuels increase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">The development of modern ZNE buildings became possible, not only through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and
                techniques, but also improved by significant scientific research, which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental
                buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">Heating and insulating buildings</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Architects need to know how well different materials will insulate the building they design. To help them with this they need to know the
                U-values of different materials.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">A U-value of 1 W/(m2 ºC) means a 1 metre square area of the material with a 1ºC temperature difference across the material will conduct
                heat at a rate of 1 joule per second.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">U-values measure how effective the properties of the insulating materials are. The lower the U-value the better the material is at insulating.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">U-values for windows (Uw-values)</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell ThermaLine™ windows and doors have been designed to allow building designers to achieve energy efficient designs. They are efficient in
                terms of Uw-value and also air leakages rates to minimise heating and cooling loads.</p>
