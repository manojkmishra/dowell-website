            <p class="p-therma">The Dowell ThermaLine™ thermal barrier is made of high quality polyamide and glass fiber construction providing superior
                insulation and geometry tolerance. Polyamide has high mechanical strength and exceptional heat, UV and chemical resistance,
                which ensure the thermal strip’s geometry tolerance.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The glass fiber compound makes the thermal barrier strip durable, but most of all it matches the thermal barrier strip’s
                Linear Thermal Expansion Co-Efficient (LTEC) with that of the aluminum’s.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The thermal barrier geometry affects the quality of composite profile. A thermal break with poor geometry results in poor
                geometry of the composite profiles which also has built-in stress, leading to poor performance such as air tightness, water
                tightness and wind resistance.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">CONDENSATION</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">Condensation arises because warm air can hold more moisture than cold air. For example, air at 25°C can hold about 20 grams
                of water per kilogram of air. This is its maximum water content so it corresponds to 100% humidity. If air in this state is
                cooled to 15°C, then its maximum water content falls to about half this value and about 10 grams of water must condense out of
                each kilogram of air. This will occur as a fog of liquid droplets if the air is cooled as a mass, or as condensation on a surface
                if that surface provides local cooling of the air around it.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Common examples of surface condensation include; condensation upon a window glass and/or aluminium frame as a result of the
                reduced temperature of the glass and/or aluminium frame in a warm environment or as a result of increasing moisture levels within
                the room.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">If air is cooled below its dew point (i.e. cooled to a temperature where its relative humidity would exceed 100%, so that it
                cannot contain all of the water originally present), then a fog or condensation will occur. If the air is relatively moist then
                the dew point temperature will not be far below the actual air temperature, so condensation occurs readily. Drier air will have
                a dew point which is proportionately low, so that condensation will only occur if it comes into contact with surfaces which are
                much colder.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">Condensation in buildings</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The ingredients for condensation are essentially one or more
                of the following: <br>
                • The presence of moisture levels which are too high. <br>
                • The low temperatures of building materials. <br>
                • Uncontrolled flow of water vapour from a source to a region
                of cold temperature.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Moisture levels within buildings are often higher than outdoors, and there are numerous reasons for this. One source of moisture
                is the ground. Concrete slabs generally provide a</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-4 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">waterproof barrier to ground moisture, but buildings with suspended timber floors (typical of many houses) are quite susceptible
                to high indoor humidity arising from moist sub-floor spaces. Domestic activities produced by; cooking, bathing, showering, drying,
                high occupancy, high indoor plant concentrations, uncontrolled moisture ingress and domestic appliances such as gas or oil fired stoves,
                burners and heaters.</p>

            <p class="mini-heading">Typical quantities of water vapour produced in the home are (in litres per hour):</p>

            <p class="p-therma">• Adult (breathing) 0.1 <br>
                • Hot bath 1.5 <br>
                • Clothes drier 5.0 <br>
                • Hot shower 10.0</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Condensation on inside surfaces is generally a winter (or heating season) problem. Insufficiently insulated surfaces become cold enough
                to fall below the dew point of indoor air and condensation necessarily occurs. Aluminium window frames are particularly susceptible because
                they ‘face out’ on a cold day/night.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">As shown in our diagram (based on 21ºC internal temperature), the dew point (start of condensation), is when the outside temperature is
                at 8ºC for a standard aluminium frame and at -4ºC for a Dowell ThermaLine™ thermally broken aluminium awning window, when humidity inside a
                home increases due to activity such as people breathing, cooking, showering and drying - with typical internal humidity being around 50-60%.
                Even in extreme internal humidity level of 60%, Dowell ThermaLine™ dew point is not achieved until the outside temperature falls below 2.5ºC.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell ThermaLine™ thermal barrier reduces moisture build-up and the unsightly mould growth that cause respiratory illness or asthma,
                chronic cough, rashes (dermatitis) and sinus problems, caused by internal surface condensation.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">PERFORMANCE</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">A Dowell ThermaLine™ window is so much more than just the glass and many people underestimate the role of the window frame in energy
                efficient home design. In fact the most energy efficient windows result from a combination of both an insulated frame and the right glass
                to achieve superior energy performance.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The Dowell ThermaLine™ frame is made with aluminium – a uniquely strong, lightweight, ductile, corrosion resistant material that
                can also be recycled – with insulation properties added into the frame to ensure minimal transfer of heat.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The thermal break technology in Dowell ThermaLine™ is created using a highly engineered polyamide (plastic) strip that acts as a
                thermal barrier between the outer and inner aluminium components of the window frame. This minimises the transfer of heat and cold
                through the window frame, resulting in improved energy efficiency.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">To better meet the needs of our customers. Dowell ThermaLine™ offers a range of double glazed glass options.</p>
