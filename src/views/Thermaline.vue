            <p class="p-therma">Dowell has been creating innovative window and door solutions in Australia, since 1860.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Holding true to its name, Dowell added a sliding door and four new energy efficient
                windows into its ThermaLine™ range. These windows and doors herald a new era in affordable,
                energy efficient design and in 2012 was awarded the HIA GreenSmart product of the year award.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">HIA Judges stated; “ThermaLine™ windows are a versatile, high performing and cost effective
                aluminium window range. The new ThermaLine™ frame has a similar thermal performance to the
                installed glass. With Uw-values* as low as 1.7, the windows are rated the best in its class.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The low Uw-values benefit homes with large amounts of glazing to achieve 6 stars or better.
                The product range consists of an awning window, fixed window, sliding window and sliding door
                designed to be a cost effective solution for energy savings to the residential housing market.”</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Dowell ThermaLine™ windows and doors are double glazed, thermally broken aluminium frames
                that are approved by the National Asthma Council Australia’s Sensitive Choice® program. With
                Dowell ThermaLine™ condensation and the likelihood of mould growth is reduced, creating a
                healthy and comfortable living environment.</p>
            <p class="p-therma">The Sensitive Choice® blue butterfly symbol is a way of recognising products and services that

            <h2 class="blue thick">COMFORT</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">During winter (cooler climates) Dowell ThermaLine™ windows help reduce cool air entering the home
                and help keep warm air indoors. Condensation is reduced considerably, which often occurs as a result
                of large differences in temperature between the interior and exterior environments.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">In summer (warmer climates) Dowell ThermaLine™ windows help act as a buffer against the hot air outside,
                minimising the transfer of heat into a building. Dowell ThermaLine™ will help minimise the loss of cool air,
                reducing the size and need for air-conditioners.</p>

        <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-s-12">
            <p class="p-therma">U-value is a measure of heat transfer/loss in a building element. Lower U-values indicate higher levels of
                insulation. Dowell ThermaLine™ window and door product range consistently produce very low Uw-values..</p>

            <p class="p-therma">Solar Heat Gain Co-Efficient (SHGC) is a measure of how much solar radiation passes through a window.
                For comfort during the summer months, the smaller the SHGC the better. With SHGC’s as low as 0.18* for the
                hotter climates and SHGC of 0.55* for the cooler climates, the Dowell ThermaLine™ range will help provide
                year-round comfort in a home.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">HEAT LOSS / HEAT GAIN</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">As much as 49% of the heat lost during winter and as much as 87% of the heat gained during summer can
                come from the windows*.</p>
            <p class="p-therma">In Melbourne around 75% of household energy usage is for heating, while in Brisbane, around 90% of energy
                is used for cooling homes. The emphasis on selecting the right product to reduce heat loss in a colder
                climate and reduce heat gain in a hotter climate should be an important decision to achieve greater comfort
                and energy efficiency. Choosing the right product and glazing option will help.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The award winning Dowell ThermaLine™ product range with its custom glazing options provides outstanding
                comfort, noise reduction and energy efficiency, all factors that are highly desired when constructing
                a new home or renovating an old one.</p>

            <h2 class="blue thick">PERFORMANCE</h2>

            <p class="p-therma">The most energy efficient windows result from a combination of both an insulated frame and the right glass
                (Dowell ThermaLine™ offers a range of double glazed glass options) to achieve superior energy performance.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The Dowell ThermaLine™ frame is made with aluminium – a uniquely strong, lightweight, ductile, corrosion
                resistant material that can also be recycled – with insulation properties added into the frame to ensure minimal
                transfer of heat.</p>

            <p class="p-therma">The thermal break technology in Dowell ThermaLine™ is created using a highly engineered polyamide (plastic)
                strip that acts as a thermal barrier between the outer and inner aluminium components of the window frame.
                This minimises the transfer of heat and cold through the window frame, resulting in improved energy efficiency.</p>
